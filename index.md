### CPSC 120

* Lab 4

    Lab 4, part 1 was one of my favorite labs to code and understand. It is a very
    basic lab that translate units of measurements but it taught me to simple skill
    of learning to write functions and knowing when to call them. The functions were
    all simple equations however it was interesting to see one number be converted
    into tablespoons, ounces, cups, etc.

* Lab 8

    Lab 8, part 2 is a very memorable lab for me. We had to code a program that writes
    a sentence explaining the sandwhich of your choice, using the ingredients that
    the user wrote in as command-line arguments. This was a fun lab that taught me
    how to create a vector of the command-line arguments and apply them in my code.

* Lab 11

    Lab 11, part 2 was a very challenging lab but I was able to take away quite a
    lot of information from it. We had to create a Hi-Lo game and the user had to
    try to guess the secret number. In order to execute this we had to understand
    the GameState object, a class type that holds the secret number and the count
    of how many guesses were remaining. It taught me how to initialize variables
    in an initialization list and form a constructor, and I learned how to apply
    functions from objects.
